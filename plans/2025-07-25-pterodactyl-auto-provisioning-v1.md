# Automatic Pterodactyl User and Server Creation

## Objective

### Notification Delivery Process
1. **Immediate Delivery**: Send notification immediately after successful server creation
2. **Delivery Confirmation**: Verify message delivery success
3. **Retry Mechanism**: Automatic retry if delivery fails
4. **Fallback Notification**: Alternative delivery method if WhatsApp fails
5. **Delivery Logging**: Log all notification attempts and results

### Security Measures
- Secure password generation with configurable complexity
- Encrypted credential storage during processing
- Automatic password expiry reminders
- Secure credential regeneration capabilities
- Audit trail for all credential deliveries

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Admin API Key Security**
   Mitigation: Implement secure storage, environment variable validation, and API key rotation procedures. Use least-privilege principle for API access.

2. **Provisioning Failures and Partial States**
   Mitigation: Implement comprehensive rollback mechanisms, transaction-like behavior, and detailed error logging with automatic cleanup procedures.

3. **Resource Exhaustion and Node Capacity**
   Mitigation: Implement resource availability checking, dynamic node selection, and capacity monitoring with automatic failover to alternative nodes.

4. **Concurrent Provisioning Conflicts**
   Mitigation: Implement provisioning queue system, resource locking mechanisms, and proper synchronization to prevent conflicts during simultaneous operations.

5. **Customer Credential Security**
   Mitigation: Generate strong passwords, implement secure credential delivery, and provide password change mechanisms. Use encrypted storage for sensitive data.

6. **API Rate Limiting and Timeouts**
   Mitigation: Implement proper rate limiting, retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, and timeout handling for long-running operations.

7. **Integration Complexity with Existing Order System**
   Mitigation: Maintain backward compatibility, implement feature flags for gradual rollout, and provide manual fallback procedures for critical operations.

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Manual Provisioning with Admin Interface**: Create admin web interface for manual provisioning instead of automatic - provides more control but requires manual intervention

2. **Template-Based Server Creation**: Use predefined server templates for each package type - simpler implementation but less flexible for customization

3. **Microservice Architecture**: Split provisioning into separate microservices - provides better scalability but increases deployment complexity

4. **Database-Driven Configuration**: Store all provisioning configuration in database instead of files - provides dynamic configuration but requires database management

5. **Event-Driven Provisioning**: Use event system for provisioning triggers - provides better decoupling but increases system complexity

6. **Containerized Provisioning**: Use Docker containers for provisioning logic - provides better isolation but requires container management
