# Command Plugin System Reorganization

## Objective
Reorganize the current monolithic command system in the Pterodactyl WhatsApp Bot into a modular plugin-based architecture where each command or group of related commands is placed in separate folders, similar to a plugin system. This will improve maintainability, scalability, and allow for easier addition of new commands.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create Plugin Directory Structure**
   - Dependencies: None
   - Notes: Establish organized folder structure for command plugins with clear separation by category
   - Files: `src/plugins/`, `src/plugins/general/`, `src/plugins/store/`, `src/plugins/pterodactyl/`, `src/plugins/admin/`
   - Status: Not Started

2. **Define Plugin Interface and Types**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: Create TypeScript interfaces for plugin structure, command definitions, and plugin metadata
   - Files: `src/plugins/types.ts`
   - Status: Not Started

3. **Create Plugin Base Class**
   - Dependencies: Task 2
   - Notes: Abstract base class providing common functionality for all plugins including command registration, validation, and error handling
   - Files: `src/plugins/BasePlugin.ts`
   - Status: Not Started

4. **Extract General Commands Plugin**
   - Dependencies: Task 3
   - Notes: Move help and ping commands from commandManager.ts to dedicated plugin with proper categorization
   - Files: `src/plugins/general/GeneralPlugin.ts`, `src/plugins/general/index.ts`
   - Status: Not Started

5. **Extract Store Commands Plugin**
   - Dependencies: Task 3
   - Notes: Move katalog, harga, and order commands to separate plugin with store-specific functionality
   - Files: `src/plugins/store/StorePlugin.ts`, `src/plugins/store/index.ts`
   - Status: Not Started

6. **Extract Pterodactyl Commands Plugin**
   - Dependencies: Task 3
   - Notes: Move server, start, stop, restart commands to dedicated plugin with API integration
   - Files: `src/plugins/pterodactyl/PterodactylPlugin.ts`, `src/plugins/pterodactyl/index.ts`
   - Status: Not Started

7. **Extract Admin Commands Plugin**
   - Dependencies: Task 3
   - Notes: Move admin-only commands like stats to separate plugin with proper permission handling
   - Files: `src/plugins/admin/AdminPlugin.ts`, `src/plugins/admin/index.ts`
   - Status: Not Started

8. **Create Plugin Loader System**
   - Dependencies: Task 2
   - Notes: Dynamic plugin discovery and loading system with error handling and dependency management
   - Files: `src/plugins/PluginLoader.ts`
   - Status: Not Started

9. **Refactor Command Manager**
   - Dependencies: Task 8
   - Notes: Modify CommandManager to use plugin system instead of hardcoded commands, maintain existing interfaces
   - Files: `src/commands/commandManager.ts`
   - Status: Not Started

10. **Update Main Bot Integration**
    - Dependencies: Task 9
    - Notes: Ensure bot initialization works seamlessly with new plugin system without breaking existing functionality
    - Files: `src/index.ts`
    - Status: Not Started

11. **Add Plugin Configuration System**
    - Dependencies: Task 10
    - Notes: Allow plugins to have their own configuration while maintaining compatibility with existing environment variables
    - Files: `src/plugins/PluginConfig.ts`
    - Status: Not Started

12. **Create Plugin Documentation**
    - Dependencies: Task 11
    - Notes: Comprehensive documentation for plugin development including examples and best practices
    - Files: `docs/plugin-development.md`, `docs/plugin-api.md`
    - Status: Not Started

13. **Testing and Validation**
    - Dependencies: Task 12
    - Notes: Comprehensive testing of plugin system including command execution, error handling, and plugin loading
    - Files: All plugin files and test scripts
    - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria
- All existing commands continue to work without functional changes
- New plugin system successfully loads and registers all commands
- Plugin isolation is maintained (no cross-plugin dependencies)
- Command execution performance is not degraded
- Error handling and logging continue to work as expected
- Bot startup time is not significantly increased
- Plugin system is extensible for future command additions

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Breaking Changes During Refactoring**
   Mitigation: Maintain existing CommandManager interface and gradually migrate commands while preserving backward compatibility

2. **Type Safety Issues with Dynamic Loading**
   Mitigation: Use strict TypeScript interfaces and compile-time checks where possible, implement runtime validation for dynamic components

3. **Performance Overhead from Plugin System**
   Mitigation: Use static imports at startup rather than dynamic imports during command execution, benchmark performance before and after

4. **Plugin Dependency Management**
   Mitigation: Design plugins to be self-contained with minimal dependencies, use dependency injection for shared services

5. **Debugging Complexity**
   Mitigation: Implement comprehensive logging for plugin loading and execution, maintain clear error messages with plugin context

6. **Plugin Loading Failures**
   Mitigation: Implement graceful fallback mechanisms and detailed error reporting for plugin loading issues

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Single File Per Command**: Each command in its own file rather than grouping by category - provides maximum modularity but may create too many small files

2. **Hybrid Approach**: Keep frequently used commands in main CommandManager and only extract complex or specialized commands to plugins

3. **Configuration-Based Loading**: Use JSON/YAML configuration files to define command structure rather than TypeScript classes

4. **Microservice Architecture**: Split commands into separate processes or services - provides maximum isolation but adds complexity

5. **Hot-Reloading System**: Implement runtime plugin addition/removal capabilities - provides flexibility but increases complexity significantly
